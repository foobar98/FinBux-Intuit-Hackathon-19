# FinBux

Developed a POC for a Quickbooks plugin to evaluate the financial health of a company based on economic attributes such as expenses, net profit, liabilities etc. It also gives users the option to play around with the values of such features and determine the updated health.

This was developed as part of an all-intern hackathon at Intuit.

## Usage

```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt

2. python3 main.py

3. open http://127.0.0.1:8081/
